LILO boot error codes
=====================

When LILO loads itself, it displays the word LILO. Each letter is printed 
before or after performing some specific action. If LILO fails at some point, 
the letters printed so far can be used to identify the problem.

Output    Problem
(nothing) No part of LILO has been loaded. LILO either isn't installed or the 
          partition on which its boot sector is located isn't active.
	  
L         The  first  stage  boot  loader has been loaded and started, but it
          can't load the second  stage boot loader. The two-digit error codes
	  indicate the type of problem. 
	  This condition usually indicates a media failure or a geometry 
	  mismatch (e.g. bad disk parameters).
	  
LI        The first stage boot loader was able to load the second stage boot
          loader, but has failed to execute it. This can either be caused by a
	  geometry mismatch or by moving /boot/boot.b without running the map
	  installer.

LIL       The second stage boot loader has been started, but it can't load the
          descriptor table from the map file. This is typically caused by a
	  media failure or by a geometry mismatch.
	  
LIL?      The second stage boot loader has been loaded at an incorrect address.
          This is typically caused by a subtle geometry mismatch or by moving 
	  /boot/boot.b without running the map installer.
	  
LIL-      The descriptor table is corrupt. This can either be caused by a
          geometry mismatch or by moving /boot/map without running the map
	  installer.

LILO      All parts of LILO have been successfully loaded.


      If the BIOS signals an error when LILO is trying to load a boot image,
      the  respective  error  code is displayed. These codes range from 0x00
      through 0xbb. 

      See man lilo for explanation of these codes
