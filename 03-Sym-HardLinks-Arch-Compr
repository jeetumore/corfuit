		SYMLINKS , HARDLINKS , PARTITIONS , COMPRESSION


1.)	Partition is a part of hard disk which is to be utilized for a different
	cause than it's neighbouring partition.

2.)	Partition is "Hardware" since it comes from a hard disk which is a
	hardware . Basically anything can be holded in hands is a hardware
	, and as hard disk could be , hard disk and hence partition is a h/w.

3.)	Partitions could be further subdidvided into two types -:

i.)	Primary Partitions -> It is an actual partition which can be given a
	label and can be used for some purpose. There can be max 4 primary
	partitions on a hard disk ( limitations of BIOS which was first
	inroduced by IBM and all other personal computers are it's clones.

ii.)	Extended Partition -> This is ideally not a partition but a concept
	that can be further divided into logical partitions which can be
	further given labels and used for some purpose.

4.)	Only 1 extended partition can be created from a hard disk which can be
	further sub divided to 64 logical volumes ( partitions ) . Windows
	allows only 21 logical partitions.

	Max. Number of logical volumes also depends on motherboard . In some
	cases only 16 logical volumes are allowed from an extended partition.

5.)	Windows can oly be installed on an primary , active partition.

6.)	Drive in Windows = Filesystem in Linux

7.)	Normally the important directories which if filled could hamper the
	functioning of system are made a totally different filesystem on a
	different partition in linux.

	Normally , the various directories which are given different partitions
	are /boot , / , /home , /tmp , /var , /usr .

	For eg. -> /home is the directory in which all users have their home
	directories , if there is no quota policy for users in place , in
	case they dump more and more data in their home directories and if
	/home is not in another partition , all data will be going into the
	"/" directory and ultimately it gets filled up . This will make the
	system slow and ultimately system may hang and will give problems
	later while booting.Even the root user will not be able to login
	because his home directory ( /root ) is in / directory which is
	already full.

	To slove above problem , root user can login from linux rescue mode
	and try to do the cleanup.

8.)	'df' is command used to see all filesystems present on the system and
	being used by linux kernel and their current usage.

	df -h gives the output in human readable form ( in MB's )

		For eg. ->	df -h
	Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
	/dev/hda7             950M  116M  786M  13% /
	/dev/hda6              99M  9.2M   85M  10% /boot
	none                  109M     0  109M   0% /dev/shm
	/dev/hda10            950M   17M  885M   2% /tmp
	/dev/hda12            8.3G  4.5G  3.5G  57% /usr
	/dev/hda11            950M  263M  639M  30% /var
	/dev/vg/lv            465M  8.1M  433M   2% /home

9.)	Minimum 3 partitions required for a successful installation

	/boot , / , swap

10.) 	7 Partitions required for a successful and efficient linux installation

	/boot , / , /home , swap , /tmp , /var , /usr

11.)	For getting an optimum performance from a system , no partition should
	be filled more than 82% of it's size.

12.)	Link is a type of shorcut which is used to point out to files in
	locations which involve typing a long path to access them.

	A Link can further subdivided into Synlink and Hardlink.

13.)	Symlink / Symbolic Link / Softlink

	It is a shortcut as mentioned above.

	It can be created using the "ln -s" command

			ln -s TARGET LINK_NAME

	For eg ->	ln -s /usr/bin/clear /sbin/c

	Above command will create a symlink "c" in location /sbin which is
	pointing to a file ( actually binary ) "clear" in /usr/bin. This comes
	in handy for typing only c to clear the screen.

	Links can be used for backward compatibilty between softwares.


14.)	Hardlink

	It is also a shortcut as mentioned in links defination.

	It can be created using the "ln" command

                        ln TARGET LINK_NAME

15.)	Properties of Softlink and Hardlink

				SoftLink

i.) 	It is a shortcut.

ii.)	Size of symlink has no relation with size of the file it is pointing to
	,instead the size of symlink depends on the characters in the path
	of the TARGET link name.

iii.)	Symlinks can cross partitions.

iv.)	On deleting symlinks , parent file does not get affected.

v.)	On deleting the parent file , the symlink becomes an orphan symlink.



				Hardlink

i.)	Size of Hardlink is the same as Parent / TARGET file name.

ii.)	Hardlinks cannot cross partitions.

iii.)	It is a shorcut to parent item.

iv.)	In case parent gets deleted , hardlink still exists.


16.)	Compression is a technique to reduce the size of bunch of files
	stacked together.

	It has 2 steps -:

i.) 	Archiving

ii.)	Compression


17.)				Archiving

	This is a process of collecting the files which have to
	be compressed and make a single file out of them i.e an "archive".

	An archive is made using "tar" ( Tape Archive Command )

			tar -cvf large.tar *
			     |||
			     || File Name
			     ||
			     ||
			     |Show Verbose Output
			     |
			     Create A Single File

	Above Command Makes an archive "large.tar" and puts all the files in
	in current directory in it.

18.)				Compression

	There are various tools to compress the file . They are as follows -:


i.)	Compress and Uncompress Tool

			compress large.tar

	Above command makes a compressed file large.tar.Z in the current
	directory.

	To uncompress the file uncompress tool is used

			uncompress large.tar.Z

	A shorcut command to do the compressing is ( Archiving + Compression )

			tar -Zcvf large.tar.Z

	A shorcut command to do the uncompressing is ( Archiving + Compression )

                        tar -Zxvf large.tar.Z


ii.)    GZIP and GUNZIP Tool

                        gzip large.tar

        Above command makes a compressed file large.tar.z in the current
        directory.

        To uncompress the file gunzip tool is used

                        gunzip large.tar.z

        A shorcut command to do the compressing is ( Archiving + Compression 
)

                        tar -zcvf large.tar.z

        A shorcut command to do the uncompressing is ( Archiving + Compression )

			tar -zxvf large.tar.z

iii.)    BZIP2 and BUNZIP2 Tool

                        bzip2 large.tar

        Above command makes a compressed file large.tar.bz2 in the current
        directory.

        To uncompress the file bunzip2 tool is used

                        bunzip2 large.tar.bz2

        A shorcut command to do the compressing is ( Archiving + Compression 
)

                        tar -jcvf large.tar.bz2

        A shorcut command to do the uncompressing is ( Archiving + Compression )

			tar -jxvf large.tar.bz2

19.)	When binary comes into RAM , it is called a DAEMON.

	Each Process when comes in RAM , is assigned a unique number known
	as Process ID ( or PID ).


20.)		Application Daemon or SERVER

i.)	User starts the process , it becomes a server , and user ultimately
	stops it.

ii.)	System will not crash if this process stops.


21.)            System Daemon or KERNEL THREAD

i.)    System starts the process , it becomes a kernel thread , and ultimately
	system only stops it.

ii.)   System will crash if this process stops.
